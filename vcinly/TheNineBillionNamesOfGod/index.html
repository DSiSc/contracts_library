        <p>"This is a slightly unusual request," said Dr. Wagner, with what he hoped was commendable restraint. "As far as I
            know, it's the rst time anyone's been asked to supply a Tibetan monastery with an automatic sequence computer.
            I don't wish to be inquisitive, but I should hardly thought that your-ah-establishment had much use for such
            a machine. Could you explain just what you intend to do with it?"</p>
        <p>"Gladly," replied the lama, readjusting his silk robe and carefully putting away the slide rule he had been using
            for currency conversions. "Your Mark V computer can carry out any routine mathematical operation involving up
            to ten digits. How- ever, for our work we are interested in letters, not numbers. As we wish you to modify the
            output circuits, the machine will be printing words, not columns of gures."</p>
        <p>"I don't understand. . . "</p>
        <p>"This is a project on which we have been working for the last three centuries since the lamasery was founded, in
            fact. It is somewhat alien to your way of thought, so I hope you will listen with an open mind while I explain
            it."
        </p>
        <p>"Naturally."</p>
        <p>"It is really quite simple. We have been compiling a list which shall contain all the possible names of God."</p>
        <p>"I beg your pardon?"</p>
        <p>"We have reason to believe," continued the lama imperturbably, "that all such names can be written with not more
            than nine letters in an alphabet we have devised."</p>
        <p>"And you have been doing this for three centuries?"</p>
        <p>"Yes. We expected it would take us about fteen thousand years to complete the task."</p>
        <p>"Oh." Dr. Wagner looked a little dazed. "Now I see why you wanted to hire one of our machines. But exactly what is
            the purpose of this project?"</p>
        <p>The lama hesitated for a fraction of a second, and Wagner wondered if he had o ended him. If so, there was no trace
            of annoyance in the reply.</p>
        <p>"Call it ritual, if you like, but it's a fundamental part of our belief. All the many names of the Supreme Being-God,
            Jehovah, Allah, and so on-they are only man-made labels. There is a philosophical problem of some di culty here,
            which I do not propose to discuss, but somewhere among all the possible combinations of letters, which can
            occur, are what one may call the real names of God. By systematic permutation of letters, we have been trying
            to list them all."</p>
        <p>"I see. You've been starting at AAAAAAAAA. . . and working up to ZZZZZZZZZ..."</p>
        <p>"Exactly-though we use a special alphabet of our own. Modifying the electromatic typewriters to deal with this is,
            of course, trivial. A rather more interesting problem is that of devising suitable circuits to eliminate ridiculous
            combinations. For example, no letter must occur more than three times in succession."</p>
        <p>"Three? Surely you mean two."</p>
        <p>"Three is correct. I am afraid it would take too long to explain why, even if you understood our language."</p>
        <p>"I'm sure it would," said Wagner hastily. "Go on."</p>
        <p>"Luckily it will be a simple matter to adapt your automatic sequence computer for this work, since once it has been
            programmed properly it will permute each letter in turn and print the result. What would have taken us fteen
            thousand years it will be able to do in a thousand days."</p>
        <p>Dr. Wagner was scarcely conscious of the faint sounds from the Manhattan streets far below. He was in a di erent
            world, a world of natural, not man-made, mountains. High up in their remote aeries these monks had been patiently
            at work, generation after generation, compiling their lists of meaningless words. Was there any limit to the
            follies of mankind? Still, he must give no hint of his inner thoughts. The customer was always right. . .</p>
        <p>"There's no doubt," replied the doctor, "that we can modify the Mark V to print lists of this nature. I'm much more
            worried about the problem of installation and maintenance. Getting out to Tibet, in these days, is not going
            to be easy."</p>
        <p>"We can arrange that. The components are small enough to travel by air-that is one reason why we chose your machine.
            If you can get them to India, we will provide transport from there."</p>
        <p>"And you want to hire two of our engineers?"</p>
        <p>"Yes, for the three months which the project should occupy."</p>
        <p>"I've no doubt that Personnel can manage that." Dr. Wagner scribbled a note on</p>
        <p>his desk pad. "There are just two other points"</p>
        <p>Before he could nish the sentence, the lama had produced a small slip of paper. "This is my certi ed credit balance
            at the Asiatic Bank."</p>
        <p>"Thank you. It appears to be-ah-adequate. The second matter is so trivial that</p>
        <p>I hesitate to mention it-but it's surprising how often the obvious gets overlooked. What source of electrical energy
            have you?"</p>
        <p>"A diesel generator providing 50 kilowatts at 110 volts. It was installed about ve years ago and is quite reliable.
            It's made life at the lamasery much more comfortable, but of course it was really installed to provide power
            for the motors driving the prayer wheels."</p>
        <p>"Of course," echoed Dr. Wagner. "I should have thought of that."</p>
        <p>The view from the parapet was vertiginous, but in time one gets used to anything. After three months George Hanley
            was not impressed by the two-thousand-foot swoop into the abyss or the remote checkerboard of elds in the valley
            below. He was leaning against the wind-smoothed stones and staring morosely at the distant mountains whose names
            he had never bothered to discover.</p>
        <p>This, thought George, was the craziest thing that had ever happened to him. "Project ShangriLa," some wit at the
            labs had christened it. For weeks now, Mark V had been churning out acres of sheets covered with gibberish. Patiently,
            inexorably, the computer had been rearranging letters in all their possible combinations, exhausting each class
            before going on to the next. As the sheets had emerged from the electromatic typewriters, the monks had carefully
            cut them up and pasted them into enormous books. In another week, heaven be praised, they would have finished.
            Just what obscure calculations had convinced the monks that they needn't bother to go on to words of ten, twenty,
            or a hundred letters, George didn't know. One of his recurring nightmares was that there would be some change
            of plan and that the High Lama (whom they'd naturally called Sam Ja e, though he didn't look a bit like him)
            would suddenly announce that the project would be extended to approximately 2060 a.d. They were quite capable
            of it.</p>
        <p>George heard the heavy wooden door slam in the wind as Chuck came out onto the parapet beside him. As usual, Chuck
            was smoking one of the cigars that made him so popular with the monks-who, it seemed, were quite willing to embrace
            all the minor and most of the major pleasures of life. That was one thing in their favor: they might be crazy,
            but they weren't bluenoses. Those frequent trips they took down to the village, for instance..." "Listen, George,"
            said Chuck urgently. "I've learned something that means trouble."</p>
        <p>"What's wrong? Isn't the machine behaving?" That was the worst contingency George could imagine. It might delay his
            return, than which nothing could be more horrible. The way he felt now, even the sight of a TV commercial would
            seem like manna from heaven. At least it would be some link from home.</p>
        <p>"No-it's nothing like that." Chuck settled himself on the parapet, which was unusual, because normally he was scared
            of the drop.</p>
        <p>"I've just found out what all this is about."</p>
        <p>"What d'ya mean-I thought we knew."</p>
        <p>"Sure-we know what the monks are trying to do. But we didn't know why. It's the craziest thing"</p>
        <p>"Tell me something new," growled George.</p>
        <p>". . . but old Sam's just come clean with me. You know the way he drops in every</p>
        <p>afternoon to watch the sheets roll out. Well, this time he seemed rather excited, or at least as near as he'll ever
            get to it. When I told him we were on the last cycle he asked me, in that cute English accent of his, if I'd
            ever wondered what they were trying to do. I said, 'Sure'-and he told me."</p>
        <p>"Go on, I'll buy it."</p>
        <p>"Well, they believe that when they have listed all His names-and they reckon that there are about nine billion of
            them-God's purpose will have been achieved. The human race will have nished what it was created to do, and there
            won't be any point in carrying on. Indeed, the very idea is something like blasphemy."</p>
        <p>"Then what do they expect us to do? Commit suicide?"</p>
        <p>"There's no need for that. When the list's completed, God steps in and simply winds things up. . . bingo!"</p>
        <p>"Oh, I get it. When we nish our job, it will be the end of the world."</p>
        <p>Chuck gave a nervous little laugh.</p>
        <p>"That's just what I said to Sam. And do you know what happened? He looked</p>
        <p>at me in a very queer way, like I'd been stupid in class, and said, ‘It's nothing as trivial as that'."</p>
        <p>George thought this over for a moment.</p>
        <p>"That's what I call taking the Wide View," he said presently.</p>
        <p>"But what d'ya suppose we should do about it? I don't see that it makes the</p>
        <p>slightest di erence to us. After all, we already knew that they were crazy." "Yes-but don't you see what may happen?
            When the list's complete and the Last Trump doesn't blow-or whatever it is that they expect-we may get the blame.</p>
        <p>It's our machine they've been using. I don't like the situation one little bit."</p>
        <p>"I see," said George slowly. "You've got a point there. But this sort of thing's happened here before, you know.
            When I was a kid down in Louisiana we had a crackpot preacher who said the world was going to end next Sunday.
            Hundreds of people believed him- even sold their homes. Yet nothing happened; they didn't turn nasty, as you'd
            expect. They just decided that he'd made a mistake in his</p>
        <p>calculations and went right on believing. I guess some of them still do."</p>
        <p>"Well, this isn't Louisiana, in case you hadn't noticed. There are just two of us and hundreds of these monks. I
            like them, and I'll be sorry for old Sam when his</p>
        <p>lifework back res on him. But all the same, I wish I was somewhere else."</p>
        <p>"I've been wishing that for weeks. But there's nothing we can do until the contract's nished and the transport arrives
            to y us out."</p>
        <p>"Of course," said Chuck thoughtfully, "we could always try a bit of sabotage." "Like hell we could! That would make
            things worse."</p>
        <p>"Not the way I meant. Look at it like this. The machine will nish its run four</p>
        <p>days from now, on the present twenty-hours-a-day basis. The transport calls in a week. O.K., then all we need to
            do is to nd something that wants replacing during one of the overhaul periods-something that will hold up the
            works for a couple of days. We'll x it, of course, but not too quickly. If we time matters properly, we can be
            down at the air eld when the last name pops out of the register. They won't be able to catch us then."</p>
        <p>"I don't like it," said George. "It will be the rst time I ever walked out on a job.</p>
        <p>Besides, it would make them suspicious. No, I'll sit tight and take what comes."</p>
        <p>"I still don't like it," she said seven days later, as the tough little mountain ponies carried them down the winding
            road. "And don't you think I'm running away because I'm afraid. I'm just sorry for those poor old guys up there,
            and I don't want to be around when they nd what suckers they've been. Wonder how Sam will take it?"</p>
        <p>"It's funny," replied Chuck, "but when I said goodbye I got the idea he knew we</p>
        <p>were walking out on him-and that he didn't care because he knew the machine was running smoothly and that the job
            would soon be nished. After that-well, of course, for him there just isn't any After That. . . "</p>
        <p>George turned in his saddle and stared back up the mountain road. This was the last place from which one could get
            a clear view of the lamasery. The squat, angular buildings were silhouetted against the afterglow of the sunset;
            here and there lights gleamed like portholes in the sides of an ocean liner. Electric lights, of course, sharing
            the same circuit as the Mark V. How much longer would they share it? wondered George. Would the monks smash up
            the computer in their rage and disappointment? Or would they just sit down quietly and begin their calculations
            all over again?</p>
        <p>He knew exactly what was happening up on the mountain at this very moment. The High Lama and his assistants would
            be sitting in their silk robes, inspecting the sheets as the junior monks carried them away from the typewriters
            and pasted them into the great volumes. No one would be saying anything. The only sound would be the incessant
            patter, the never-ending rainstorm, of the keys hitting the paper, for the Mark V itself was utterly silent as
            it ashed through its thousands of calculations a second. Three months of this, thought George, was enough to
            start anyone climbing up the wall.</p>
        <p>"There she is!" called Chuck, pointing down into the valley. "Ain't she beautiful!"</p>
        <p>She certainly was, thought George. The battered old DC-3 lay at the end of the runway like a tiny silver cross. In
            two hours she would be bearing them away to freedom and sanity. It was a thought worth savoring like a ne liqueur.
            George let it roll around in his mind as the pony trudged patiently down the slope.</p>
        <p>The swift night of the high Himalayas was now almost upon them. Fortunately the road was very good, as roads went
            in this region, and they were both carrying torches. There was not the slightest danger, only a certain discomfort
            from the bitter cold. The sky overhead was perfectly clear and ablaze with the familiar, friendly stars. At least
            there would be no risk, thought George, of the pilot being unable to take o because of weather conditions. That
            had been his only remaining worry. He began to sing but gave it up after a while. This vast arena of mountains,
            gleaming like whitely hooded ghosts on every side, did not encourage such ebullience.</p>

        <p>Presently George glanced at his watch.</p>
        <p>"Should be there in an hour," he called back over his shoulder to Chuck. Then</p>
        <p>he added, in an afterthought, "Wonder if the computer's nished its run? It was due about now."</p>
        <p>Chuck didn't reply, so George swung round in his saddle. He could just see Chuck's face, a white oval turned toward
            the sky.</p>
        <p>"Look," whispered Chuck, and George lifted his eyes to heaven. (There is always a last time for everything.)</p>
        <p>Overhead, without any fuss, the stars were going out.</p>

        <p>“这个要求有点出乎意料啊。”瓦格纳博士说——他居然克制住了自己的情绪，真是少有，“据我所知，这还是第一次有人提出要向西藏的寺院供应一台自动序列计算机。不是我喜欢多问，但我真的很难想象你们这种……嗯……‘宗教团体’会有使用这种计算机的需求。能请您解释一下你们打算用它做什么吗？”</p>
        <p>“非常乐意。”那位上师回答道。他整理了一下身上的丝质僧袍，小心翼翼地将刚才用来换算货币的计算尺放到一边，说：“你们的马克-V型计算机可以处理十位数以上的常规数学运算，但我们的功课比较特殊，我们更关注的是字母，而非数字。所以我们希望你们调整一下输出格式，让计算机打印出文字，而不是一串串数字。”</p>
        <p>“我不太明白……”</p>
        <p>“过去的三百年间，我们一直在做这样的功课——实际上，这座寺院就是为此而建的。以您的思维方式，这事听起来或许有些不可思议，所以我解释的时候，还希望您不要有成见。”</p>
        <p>“那是当然。”</p>
        <p>“说起来其实很简单，我们正在编撰名录，把至高之神所有可能的名字书写下来。”</p>
        <p>“对不起，您说什么？”</p>
        <p>“我们有理由相信，”上师泰然自若地继续说，“我们选定的九个字母，经过排列组合，便能将神所有的名字都列出来。”</p>
        <p>“你们就把这做了三个世纪？”</p>
        <p>“是啊，我们原本预计，完成大概需要一万五千年。”</p>
        <p>“哦，”瓦格纳博士看上去有点发晕，“现在我明白你们干嘛要租一台计算机了。但你们做这个……‘功课’，究竟有什么目的呢？”</p>
        <p>上师犹豫了片刻，瓦格纳不知自己是否冒犯了他。但即使如此，对方回答的时候也没有表现出一丝一毫的火气。</p>
        <p>“如果您愿意的话，也可以将之称为一种‘仪式’，但这是我们信仰的基础。那至高无上的存在有许多名字——上帝、耶和华、安啦，等等等等……不过这些都是人造的符号。这里涉及到一系列复杂的数学问题，我不打算在此细说。总之，您要知道，如果能穷尽所有字母所有可能的排列组合，那么我们一定能找到那位至高神真正的名字。我们的功课就是要列出所有的名字。”</p>
        <p>“我明白了，你们是要从AAAAAAAAA开始，一直排列到ZZZZZZZZZ。”</p>
        <p>“完全正确，只不过我们使用的是我们发明的特殊的字母表。这功课非常繁琐，所以我们打算借助于更完善的电子设备。我们还需要设计相应的程序以排除不合理的排列项。例如在一个名字中，同一个字母不能出现三次。”</p>
        <p>“三次？应该是两次吧？”</p>
        <p>“是三次，没有错。您不明白我们的语言组合规律。但就算您懂得，要解释清楚恐怕也需要很长时间。”</p>
        <p>“我想也是，”瓦格纳着急地说，“请继续。”</p>
        <p>“幸运的是，就功课的内容来看，调整自动序列计算机是相当容易的。只要编程合理，它就能够把字母按照一定的规律排列打印出来。完成这功课原本需要一万五千年，有了计算机，只要一百天就够了。”</p>
        <p>瓦格纳博士几乎听不见楼下隐约传来的曼哈顿大街上的喧哗了，他仿佛进入了另一个世界，群山环绕，渺无人迹，高山之巅的僻静的寺院，僧人们耐心地排列组合着没有人认识的字母，一代又一代，把那些毫无意义的名字誊写下来……人类的愚昧当真没有极限吗？</p>
        <p>不过，这只是他内心的想法，决不可表现出哪怕分毫，毕竟，顾客就是他们的至高之神。</p>
        <p>“没有问题，”博士回答，“我们可以给计算机进行适当的编程。不过我更担心的是安装和维护，在几天之内把机器运到西藏可没有那么容易啊。”</p>
        <p>“我们会妥善处理的。马克-V型的部件都很小，完全可以空运——这也是我们选择它的一个原因。只要你们把机器运到印度，剩下的就交给我们好了。”</p>
        <p>“您还要在我们这儿雇两位工程师？”</p>
        <p>“是的，计算机要连续运行三个多月，最好有专人维护。”</p>
        <p>“我相信人事部会安排妥当的，”瓦格纳博士拿过桌上的便签本，潦草地记了几笔，“还有两件事……”</p>
        <p>还没等他说完，上师便拿出一张小纸条。</p>
        <p>“这是我们在亚洲银行经过认证的信贷余额。”</p>
        <p>“谢谢。让我看看，嗯，足够了。最后还有一点，是细节问题，我有点犹豫要不要说——还是说吧，因为这事儿其实挺重要的，却经常被人忽略：你们那儿用的是哪种电源？”</p>
        <p>“一台柴油发电机，功率50千瓦，电压110伏。五年前就安装了，至今运转良好。有了它，寺院里的生活变得更加舒适了。不过，当然，当初之所以安装它，是为了带动转经筒的电机。”</p>
        <p>“当然，”瓦格纳博士说，“我应该想到的。”</p>

        <p>凭栏远眺，山下的景色令人头晕目眩，但乔治·翰利已经见惯不怪了。已经过去了三个月，无论是两千英尺直插深谷的巍巍断崖，还是远处山谷中如棋盘交错的梯田，都已近无法让他提起兴致。他靠在被山风打磨得光滑如镜的石壁上，愁眉苦脸地盯着远处的群峰。至于它们的名字，他一直懒得问。</p>
        <p>真是的……我怎么会摊上这么倒霉的事儿！乔治心想。“香格里拉计划”！那些躲在实验室里的滑头们是这么叫的吧！</p>
        <p>几个星期以来，马克-V型计算机输出的打印纸足以覆盖几英亩的梯田，但上面都是些莫名其妙的符号。还是冷冰冰的计算机有耐心啊，它穷尽了那些字母的各种排列组合，不知疲倦地排完一组又一组。打印纸源源不断地从打印机中涌出。那些僧侣们小心翼翼地把它们切开，再装订成一卷又一卷厚厚的大书。</p>
        <p>感谢上帝。还有一个星期就要完工了。还好他们只用九个字母，而不是十个、二十个，甚至一百个……究竟是什么深奥的计算让他们如此笃定？乔治一无所知。</p>
        <p>但他最近总是做噩梦，其中一个尤其频繁，挥之不去。在梦中，计划有变！一个高个子的上师竟然宣布说计划会延续到公元2060年。天哪！这种事儿他们绝对干得出来！</p>
        <p>猎猎山风中，乔治听到厚重的木门砰地一响，是查克。他冲过来扑到栏杆上，像往常一样叼着雪茄，这幅派头让他很受僧侣们的欢迎——其实这些僧侣们很开明，他们能作决断又不拘泥，还似乎很享受生活的乐趣。最让他俩欣慰的是，他们虽然在有些事情上可能有点疯狂，但绝不像清教徒那么偏执。比如说，他们经常会下山，到那些偏远的山寨中去……</p>
        <p>“听我说，乔治！”查克急切地说，“出事儿了！咱们有麻烦了！”</p>
        <p>“怎么了？计算机出故障了？”乔治能想到的最坏的事儿莫过于此，这会推迟他回家的时间。再没有比这更可怕的事儿了。现在的他，哪怕能看一眼电视广告，都会觉得喝到了琼浆玉露——至少广告意味着他回家了。</p>
        <p>“不是，不是计算机的事儿，”查克扶着栏杆站直身体。这个举动很不寻常，因为他恐高，“我总算搞清楚这一切到底是怎么回事儿了！”</p>
        <p>“什么意思？咱们不是早就知道了吗？”</p>
        <p>“是啊，咱们知道这帮和尚在干吗，但你知道他们为什么要这么干吗？太疯狂了！”</p>
        <p>“你知道什么快说啊！”乔治忍不住嘘他。</p>
        <p>“刚才那个高个儿的，都对我说了。你知道，他每天下午都会来看打印的情况。但今天他显得特别兴奋，好像马上就要大功告成了一样。我对他说，程序还有最后一部分要跑完。结果他问我——就用那种特别可笑的口音，问我是不是很想知道他们在干吗。我说‘没错’，然后他就说了……”</p>
        <p>“说重点！”</p>
        <p>“好吧，他们相信，一旦把神的名字都列出来——按他们估计大概有九十亿个——神的旨意就会得到彰显，而人类的使命也就完成了。他们说神就是为此创造了人类。虽然我觉得这种想法本身就是一种亵渎。”</p>
        <p>“那他们想让我们怎么办？自行了断？”</p>
        <p>“哪有那个必要。只要名字都被列出来，神就会显示威力，然后……砰！一切就都结束了！”</p>
        <p>“哦，我明白了，一旦任务完成，就是世界末日。”</p>
        <p>查克神经兮兮地笑了一下：“我也是这么说的，结果你猜怎么着？他用一种特别奇怪的眼神看着我，就像当老师的看笨蛋学生的那种，他说：‘是啊，那又如何？’”</p>
        <p>乔治愣了一下：“真是大开眼界啊！”他说，“那你说咱们怎么办？我没觉得有啥大不了的。他们有多疯狂，咱们不是早就知道吗。”</p>
        <p>“我知道，可是，你看，不会出啥事儿吧。如果名字都列出来了，末日的号角却没有吹响——不管他们的末日是啥吧——他们会不会迁怒咱们。计算机可是咱们的呀，我一点也不想再出啥事儿了。”</p>
        <p>“我明白了，”乔治慢慢地说，“你担心的是这个啊。不过，你知道吗？这种事儿之前也发生过。我小时候住在路易斯安那州，当地有个传教士着了魔，说下周一世界就要毁灭了。还真有好几百号人相信他，他们甚至把房子都卖了。结果当然什么都没有发生，你猜怎么着，没有一个人歇斯底里。他们只是觉得传教士把日子算错了而已，还是继续相信他。我估计到现在，他们中有些人还在相信他。”</p>
        <p>“嘿，别忘了，这儿可不是路易斯安那！和这一百多个和尚呆在一起的可只有咱俩。我也很喜欢他们，一想到他们毕生的心血都化为乌有，我也很难过。但不管怎样，我可不想再呆下去了。”</p>
        <p>“几周前我就想走了！可现在咱们什么都做不了啊。只有到合同结束的日子，才有飞机来接咱们。”</p>
        <p>“那倒没错，”查克想了想又说，“不过咱们不能搞点破坏吗？”</p>
        <p>“别扯了！你就别添乱啦！”</p>
        <p>“我不是那个意思。你想啊，从现在开始，就算计算机每天只运行二十个小时，再有四天，也就都弄完了。飞机得一周后才来，对吧？所以咱们只要在例行检查的时候，找出点零件来说要换换，就能拖上一两天。当然，最后咱们肯定是要帮他们搞完的，就是中间拖延一下而已。如果时间算得正好，等最后一个名字蹦出来的时候，咱们已经下山到机场了。到那时，他们想找咱们也找不着了。”</p>
        <p>“我不喜欢这个主意，”乔治回答，“这很不职业。再说了，他们肯定会起疑心的。算了，我觉得咱们还是听天由命，看看到底会怎样吧。”</p>

        <p>“我还是不喜欢这个主意，”七天以后，乔治还在念叨这事儿，此时他已经和查克一起，骑着矮壮的山地马走在蜿蜒崎岖的山路上，“你别以为我急着离开是因为害怕，我是为山上那些老和尚们感到难过。还有，我不想继续呆下去了，因为他们早晚会发现咱俩搞的鬼。不知道上师到时候会怎么看咱们。”</p>
        <p>“你真搞笑，”查克说，“对他说‘再见’的时候，我就很清楚，他知道咱们这是要走了——但他根本不在乎，因为他知道计算机正在平稳的运行，他们的‘功课’马上就要做完了。然后——哦，当然了，对他们来说，已经没有什么‘然后’了。”</p>
        <p>乔治扭头顺着山路向后回望，现在他还能清晰地看见寺院，再往前走一点，就再也看不见了——应该说是永远看不见了。低低的寺院棱角分明，夕阳的余晖为它勾勒出一道黯淡的剪影——但一个个窗子里透出灯光，远远望去仿佛大海中远洋轮的舷窗。没错，那都是电灯，和他们的马克-V型计算机用的是同一条输电线路。但还能共用多久呢？乔治忍不住想，得到结果之后，那些僧侣们在愤怒和失望之余，会不会把计算机砸碎？还是会静静地坐下来，重新开始新一轮的计算？</p>
        <p>此刻，山上寺院里他们在做什么？乔治很清楚，那个高个子的上师和他的助手一定正披着丝质僧袍，正襟危坐，监督着其他小和尚从打印机上取下打印纸，装订成书卷。没有人说话，马克-V型计算机虽然每秒可以进行上千次运算，但它本身却悄无声息。回荡在寺院里的，只有绵绵不绝的诵经声，以及打印机的墨针敲打纸张的沙沙声，仿佛永不停歇的雨。三个月了，乔治心想，这么长的时间，简直让人发疯。</p>
        <p>“她在那儿！”查克大声嚷嚷，指着山谷，“瞧她多漂亮！”</p>
        <p>确实漂亮！那架饱经沧桑的老式道格拉斯DC3型客机正停在跑道的尽头，远远望去仿佛一枚小小的银色十字架。再过两个小时，她就会载着他们远离这荒凉之地，回到自由与文明的世界中。</p>
        <p>小矮马在陡峭的山路上，步履维艰，乔治在马背上左右摇晃，却好像痛饮了一杯醇厚的力娇酒，回家的美梦在他脑海中来回荡漾，让他沉醉。</p>
        <p>高高的喜马拉雅山，夜色总是来得这么匆忙，转眼之间便笼罩了他们。幸运的是他们已经到了路况很好的地段，前方再无任何危险。乍起的寒意让人稍微有点难受，他们举起火把，头顶的天空如此纯净，熟悉的群星闪烁，仿佛在友善地眨眼。乔治终于彻底放心了，这么好的天气，飞机一定能如常起飞。他一直在担心这个，但现在看来，纯属多余。</p>
        <p>他甚至哼起歌来，但很快就闭嘴了。四下群山巍峨，微光闪烁，峰峦若隐若现，仿佛蒙着白色面纱的重重鬼影，让他兴致索然。</p>
        <p>他看了看手表。“再有一个小时就要到机场了，”他对身后的查克大声说，想了想，又加上一句，“不知道计算机算完了没有，按说差不多是这个时间了。”</p>
        <p>查克没有回答。</p>
        <p>乔治在马鞍上摇摇晃晃地转身，看到查克正仰望天空，面无人色。</p>
        <p>“看啊……”查克轻声说。</p>
        <p>乔治也抬起头，看向夜空（万事终有尽时……）</p>
        <p>夜空中，一颗又一颗星星，慢慢地熄灭了。</p>
